# ID Card Generator for GLF 2025

This is a simple Streamlit application for generating ID cards for attending members of the Gorakhpur Literature Festival 2025 using a predefined template. Users can upload a photo, enter their name and designation, and the tool automatically resizes and fits the image into the designated frame while preserving proportions. The generated ID card can then be previewed and downloaded as a PNG file.

I was requested to develop this tool for attending members of the festival who may wish to generate personalized ID cards for themselves, which can also double as banners suitable for sharing across social platforms or personal use.
